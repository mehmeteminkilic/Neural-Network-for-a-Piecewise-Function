# Neural-Network-for-a-Piecewise-Function

This project demonstrates training a fully connected neural network to approximate a noisy, piecewise-defined function using PyTorch.

## Features

- Custom piecewise function with sine and cosine parts
- Training on noisy samples with MSE loss
- Visualization of predictions and comparison with ground truth
- Clean modular code for model and utility separation

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
